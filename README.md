This repo contains the code for the second version (really third or fourth
generation) of the i960Sx Chipset. 



# Initial Setup

After cloning the repo do the following from the root of the repo

1. ` python -m venv . `
2. ` . bin/activate `
3. ` pip install --upgrade platformio `

After this point the initial setup is done. After this all you need to do on a
new terminal is run

` . bin/activate `


# Project Structure

There are two important folders, the research directory is a scratch space to
try things out. The projects directory contains the platformio projects that I
can use to program different chips I have access to.
